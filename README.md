# HuggingFace RL

A repository for learning reinforcement learning by following HuggingFace tutorials.

## Overview

This project contains code and exercises from HuggingFace's reinforcement learning tutorials and courses. It serves as a practical learning environment for understanding RL concepts and implementations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip or conda

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Tutorials

This repository follows the HuggingFace Deep RL Course structure:

- **Unit 1**: Introduction to Deep Reinforcement Learning
- **Unit 2**: Q-Learning
- **Unit 3**: Deep Q-Learning (DQN)
- **Unit 4**: Policy Gradient Methods
- **Unit 5**: Actor-Critic Methods
- **Unit 6**: Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C/A3C)
- **Unit 7**: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- **Unit 8**: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
